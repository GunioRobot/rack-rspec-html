= Rack RSpec HTML is a simple Rack application to:
* browse your spec/ and features/ directory
* run specs and feature files living there.

== Installation

copy rack_rspec_html.rb into your #{RAILS_ROOT}/spec directory

== Starting
  $ ruby -Ilib spec/rack_rspec_html.rb

== Usage

visit http://localhost:9292 to see your specs

== NOTE
I only use it for rails, but should not be difficult to extend
